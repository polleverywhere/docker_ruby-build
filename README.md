# Docker ruby-build

A Docker image based on `ubuntu-debootstrap` with https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build installed. Poll Everywhere uses this image to build multiple Ruby versions for the `polleverywhere/ruby` image.

This image is automatically build by Dockerhub after a push is made to the [git repo](https://github.com/polleverywhere/docker_ruby-build).
